# youtuber_api
My first project after completing the Google data analytics course. 
That course taught using R but in order to expand my knowledge I will be using Python to do this.
Through this project I also learnt to find and use API's in order to scrape the data I need. While this may be secondary data, it's taken from a very trustworthy source (Google's Youtube).
This means the data integrity is high and we can rest assured that what we are getting is correct. Nonetheless I made sure to clean the dirty data and deal with things like missing values.
Being my first project and having many things I'm trying for the first time, I had to use the internet to answer a lot of questions. I will be slowly working on this as I develop my skills in order to make final product I am proud of. 
Thank you for reading this, If you have any advice please feel free to share your thoughts!
